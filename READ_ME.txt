A little QGIS plugin to find and group points within a points layer if they are at a given distance of one another.
It draw the convex hull around them. 
This plugin was meant to deal with near faunistic or floristic datas, that the user wanted to be regrouped as a station.
The user should cheack that the distance chosen is kept as small as possile in order to avoid to extended groups as chain-group effect can compromise the results.
WARNING !: it Works with projected datas only, in other words do not use geographical (long-lat type) reference systems !
